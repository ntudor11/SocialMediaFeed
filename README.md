# SMF // Social Media Feed

Final hand-in for course Mobile App Development.
By Thomas Høpfner-Dahl <thkh@itu.dk> Tudor Nastasă <tuna@itu.dk> Zander Havgaard <pezh@itu.dk>

Simple social media, with feed for text and picture based posts that sync between users.
Sync is done in paralel in the background and the feed will thus load in newer and older posts dynamically as they are needed in the user's view.
Final hand-in project for course Mobile App Development.
